# MERN airBnb Spoof

After helping out with a couple projects at spinspire, I decided to work on something a little more ambitous w/o a net (tutorial).  I did all work on this project from the docs save for 1 question re: a GET request to the server.  I was looking all over MongoDb for how to q search, it never dawned on me to check Express.  This project has helped solidify my understanding of backend code writing and forced me to work more on the front end as well (specificaly bootstrap).  

## Under Construction

I wanted to get something up on my portfolio that better represented where I'm at in my understanding of this web dev thing.  As such, there is some hard-coding in components, buttons or links that go nowhere, etc...  the project will update as I increase functionality, so bare with me.

### React and MongoDB

React is my least favorite front-end framework.  Svelte and Vue are less bulky and more intuitive with better docs, but there are more jobs using react so I'll be using that moving forward.

I chose MongoDB over Postgres because I can get the backend up and running straight from the docs.  Once I have the template up, I can manipulate the CRUD methods.  I have done 1 or 2 tutorials using postgres, and while I'm not exactly sure of the syntax, I get the concepts.
